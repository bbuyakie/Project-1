				<p>Seventh grade English teacher Kirsten Johnson listens to a student read her story about abortion to the class before giving feedback. Johnson encourages her students to own their stories, even the ugly ones, so they can turn those experiences into “expressions of art,” she said. As the teacher who started the student newspaper, Johnson brings this outlook into the newspaper. Nearly every newspaper budget meeting with her student-journalists do they have heated discussions about topics like race and discrimination.</p>

		<p>Newspapers are closing at an alarming rate, leaving many communities without a local source of printed news with nearly 1,800 papers closing since 2004. A recent University of North Carolina report shows that without these local publications, communities are more likely to become news deserts.</p>

		<p>This crisis is creating a vacuum for many of America’s suburbs, with seventy percent – 1,300 – of newspapers having closed or merged in metro areas. New York, Illinois and Texas, some of the most populated states, were hit hardest, losing the most weekly publications nationwide, according to the report.</p>

		<p>So, when Kirsten Johnson, seventh grade teacher at Madiba Prep Middle School in Bedford-Stuyvesant, made the decision to not only start a school newspaper, but also print that paper, she became an oddity in a dire industry – the dying newspaper.</p>

		<p>If presented with two choices – going home or remaining at school for two extra hours every Friday to do more work – most students might go home, but not four of Johnson’s students last spring.</p> 

		<p>The four seventh-graders – Almira George, Takeiah Henson, Noah Cummings and Joanna Contreras – saw the newspaper as an opportunity to tackle “real” subjects like race, equality and discrimination while building a community within the school, the students said in a group interview.</p>
	
		<p>Contreras wants to make people more accepting of others by making acts of discrimination public, to have discussions about race and for students to “know that nobody is better than anybody because of their background, so they aren’t above me or below me,” Contreras said. “We’re all the same because we all bleed red.”</p>

Contreras and the other student-journalists have routine discussions and debates about topics ranging from racism and equality to conspiracy theories. These are all subjects that inspire their Friday pizza and brainstorming sessions.</p>

		<p>For Johnson, the idea to start a newspaper came from the rising need to create a public forum for her students and in part to live up to the name of the school’s namesake and his clan name Madiba – Nelson Mandela.</p>
 
		<p>In her seventh grade English classes, Johnson encourages her students to discuss difficult topics that are significant to them, she said. These usually stem from personal experiences and in-class readings like Dope Sick and All American Boys, which deal with the struggles of life on the streets, drugs and race.</p>

		<p>“My students are very vocal in class, so I thought they needed a bigger platform for them to have their voices heard,” Johnson said. “They should share their thoughts with other kids.”</p>

				<p>Recently, Johnson introduced her current seventh grade English students to Realistic Fiction, a brand of fiction that is based in real life experiences. For this project, her students drew up a chart listing themes that they wish existed in books. From here, her students wrote realist fiction stories with subject matter from abortion and abuse to alcoholism and life on the street. One student said that for some of his classmate, these themes stemmed from their personal experiences.</p>

				<p>A student in Johnson's seventh grade English class writes a story based on the chart of topics they wish existed in books. Much of these stories tackeld themes one might not expect seventh graders to think about like abortion, suicide, drug abuse, single-parent households, teenage pregnancy and discrimination. Johnson said that she "tiptoes" around these themes, but she encourages her students to own these experiences and make them into something personally expressive - art.</p>

		<p>After getting the green light from Principal Anne Malcolm, Johnson said she met the four student-journalists after school one Friday, ordered pizza and, after much deliberation and disagreement, decided on a name for their newborn paper – the Madiba Buzz. From that point on, they would meet after school in room 206 every Friday for two hours to brainstorm or meet up before going into the neighborhood on assignment.</p>

		<p>Even though the resources to print the Madiba Buzz was not available last spring, the small team created different columns covering LGBTQ life, food, music and books, community profiles and student and teacher spotlights, they said.</p>

		<p>This semester, Johnson wants to print and distribute the newspaper and give her “kids” more opportunities to cover stories that matter to them. She even brought up the possibility of adding a student photographer to the team of four.</p>
